| Application Area     | Degrees of Freedom Formula           | Notes                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sample variance       | n - 1                                | One constraint from using the mean     |
| Linear regression     | n - p                                | p: number of estimated coefficients    |
| Chi-square test       | (rows - 1) * (columns - 1)           | Used in contingency tables             |
