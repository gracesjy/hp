## Degrees of Freedom in Statistics

---

### ðŸ“Œ Concept Overview

**Degrees of freedom (df)** in statistics refers to the number of independent values that can vary in an analysis, given a certain number of constraints.

#### âœ… Common Applications

| Application Area     | Degrees of Freedom Formula           | Notes                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sample variance       | n - 1                                | One constraint from using the mean     |
| Linear regression     | n - p                                | p: number of estimated coefficients    |
| Chi-square test       | (rows - 1) * (columns - 1)           | Used in contingency tables             |

## ðŸŽ² Intuitive Example

### Example: Three values with a fixed mean

- Condition: \( ar{x} = 5 \) â†’ \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 15 \)
- Degrees of freedom = 2 (two values can vary freely, the third is determined)

## ðŸ“Š Example 1: Degrees of Freedom in t-test

### Scenario

Test whether the average scores between Group A and B are significantly different (Independent t-test)

| Group A | Group B |
|--------|---------|
| 85     | 88      |
| 90     | 92      |
| 78     | 84      |
| 92     | 86      |
| 87     | 85      |

### Python Code

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

a_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 87]
b_scores = [88, 92, 84, 86, 85]

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(a_scores, b_scores)
print("t statistic:", t_stat)
print("p-value:", p_value)
```

### Result

- Degrees of freedom: \( 5 + 5 - 2 = 8 \)
- p-value > 0.05 â†’ The mean difference is not statistically significant

## ðŸ“Š Example 2: Degrees of Freedom in Chi-Square Test

### Scenario

Analyze the association between gender and purchase behavior using a contingency table.

| Gender | Purchased | Not Purchased | Total |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Male   | 30        | 10             | 40    |
| Female | 20        | 40             | 60    |
| Total  | 50        | 50             | 100   |

### Expected Frequencies

Example: Male-Purchased â†’ \( rac{40 	imes 50}{100} = 20 \)

| Gender | Purchased (Expected) | Not Purchased (Expected) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Male   | 20                   | 20                        |
| Female | 30                   | 30                        |

### Degrees of Freedom

\[
df = (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1
\]

### Python Code

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

observed = [[30, 10], [20, 40]]
chi2, p, df, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(observed)

print("Chi-square statistic:", chi2)
print("p-value:", p)
print("Degrees of freedom:", df)
print("Expected frequencies:", expected)
```

### Interpretation

- Chi-square statistic â‰ˆ 16.67
- Degrees of freedom: 1
- p < 0.05 â†’ There is a statistically significant relationship between gender and purchase behavior

## âœ… Summary

- Degrees of freedom are crucial for assessing statistical significance and determining test distribution shapes
- More constraints â†’ fewer degrees of freedom â†’ more conservative tests
- t, F, and Ï‡Â² distributions are all shaped by their degrees of freedom
