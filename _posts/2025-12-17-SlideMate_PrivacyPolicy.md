# Privacy Policy for SlideMate

**Last updated:** December 17, 2025

---

## Overview
SlideMate (“the App”) provides presentation control features (such as Bluetooth remote functionality). This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, stored, and shared, as well as user rights and security measures.

---

## Data Collection
- **Account/Personal Identifiable Information:** Not collected.
- **Contacts/Calendar/Photos:** Not collected.
- **Location Data:** Not collected.
- **Device Information (minimal):** Bluetooth connection status, device model/OS version (non-identifiable, for stability diagnostics).
- **Usage Data:** Feature usage frequency, error logs (for bug fixing and app improvement).
- **Network Data:** May be generated when checking for updates or loading help pages.

> The App only processes the minimum information required for presentation control. Personally identifiable information (PII) is not collected unless explicitly stated and consented.

---

## Permissions and Purpose
- **Bluetooth / Bluetooth LE:** Used to connect and control presentation remotes.
- **Internet (Network):** Used to load optional content (help pages, update notifications, YouTube demo).
- **Foreground Service (optional):** Used to maintain stable connection during presentations.

> Permissions are requested only when needed and are not used unnecessarily in the background.

## SlideMate App Specifics
The SlideMate mobile application does **not use internet communication** and is **not involved in any data collection**.  

Meeting recordings are entirely optional and must be initiated by the user.  
Deletion of recordings is also fully controlled by the user.  

The application does not use external storage.  
All recordings and related data remain within the program itself and are not shared or stored outside the app environment.

---

## PC Companion Specifics
The PC Companion component of SlideMate uses **Bluetooth communication only**.  
It does not create, delete, or modify any user data on the device.  

The application does not require any special permissions beyond Bluetooth connectivity.  
Pairing between the PC Companion and the mobile device relies entirely on the built‑in Windows Bluetooth functionality, and must be initiated and confirmed by the user.  

This ensures that the Companion operates strictly as a presentation control tool without accessing or altering personal files or system data.

---

## Data Usage, Storage, and Sharing
- **Purpose:** To provide functionality (connection/control), improve performance (error analysis), and support users.
- **Retention:** Error logs and usage data are stored only as long as necessary, then deleted. Legal retention requirements are followed if applicable.
- **Third-Party Sharing:** Not shared by default. Non-identifiable data may be processed for statistics or diagnostics. If external tools are introduced, they will be disclosed here.
- **International Transfer:** None planned. Any future changes will be announced in advance.

---

## Children’s Privacy
- **Not directed to children under 13.**  
- If accidental access by children is detected, data will be deleted and access blocked immediately.

---

## Security
- **Transmission Security:** Network communication uses encrypted channels (HTTPS) whenever possible.
- **Storage Security:** Data stored locally uses OS-level security mechanisms. Sensitive information is not stored.
- **Access Control:** Permissions are minimized, and internal access is restricted by logs and policies.

---

## User Rights
- **Access/Deletion Requests:** Users may contact us to request access or deletion of data, in accordance with applicable laws.
- **Consent Withdrawal:** Users may disable permissions in settings. Some features may be limited if required permissions are withdrawn.

---

## Policy Updates
This policy may be updated due to service or legal changes. Significant updates will be announced in-app or on this page. Please check the “Last updated” date.
