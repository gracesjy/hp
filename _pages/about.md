## About Me

I have been passionate about being a software developer for a long time, and I will continue to do so.

## Brief History ..
In the mid-to-late 1990s, he developed various programs such as Oracle Tuxedo, Oracle Database, UNIX Network/System Programming, 
and Windows Win32/MFC programming. In the early 2000s, he developed CTI and Telematics. 
Since 2004, he has been in charge of semiconductor-related infrastructure, product QA, The main tasks were middleware, troubleshooting, etc. 
In 2012, he worked at Oracle Korea and was involved in manufacturing consulting for Exadata, Big Data Appliance, and Oracle R Enterprise.

In 2014, I continued to participate in Hadoop-based sensor data-related analysis projects, 
and from 2018 to 2020, I was in charge of development and management of non-stop operation related to EAP (Equipment Application Program) for 
a semiconductor company.  After that, I developed OPC-UA products until the end of 2023, 
and am currently developing my product, Big Data Analysis Enabler.

## Familiar programming language
UNIX at first, It started with C/C++ as the base, and later changed to JAVA.  (2010)
Starting with Big Data projects, I was interested in Python and R, and also dealt with PySpark and Scala.  Currently, I am doing C/C++/Python/R for my product.

The language I am most interested in is Python.

## Familiar Database

Oracle Database has been developed on that basis since 1996.  Initially, it was implemented with Pro*C based on Oracle Tuxedo, 
and the current product is based on Oracle Data Catridge Interface and OCI.  Other databases are only used, 
but Oracle Database has been built and operated to some extent.

## Embedded ..
The embedded field was at its peak in the late 1990s, and after that, OPC-UA was planted in Box.  
I know how to make PLC communication, etc., but because it is so vast, I had to use commercially available tools for this part.
