### Note of understanding

While I was working on officially uploading it to the Google Play Store, I realized that it would be too much of a hassle to have 12 testers, so I apologize for uploading it this way. At least it won't affect your system, and since it doesn't connect to the internet, it won't leak data or delete or create files.
