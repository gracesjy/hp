Raymond Development areas of interest !

## Big Data Analysis Enabler for Oracle Database

This is my personal product.  It is an Oracle In-Database product used with Oracle Database Instance, 
and you can run Python and R as SQL statements and receive the results like regular SQL results.

Although I cannot dare to compare it with Oracle R Enterprise, we were only able to implement a few important parts, 
such as parallel and distributed processing.

It was developed first as a Python module, and it is more complete than R and is very easy to install because of Anaconda.
The implementation consists of C/C++, Oracle PL/SQL, Function, Type, View, etc.

## OPC-UA with prosys SDK

This is an implementation of OPC-UA, an international standard protocol for IOT.  
It is no different from making and delivering it alone. Originally, open source from the Eclipse Milo project was used, 
but delivery of this open source was difficult due to insufficient implementation of important Alarm and Event parts.
So I implemented it using prosys.   PLC communication is also very clean and verified because it uses commercial products.  
For reference, it is implemented in JAVA.
