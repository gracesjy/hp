This site is where Raymond posts his personal solutions, developments, and prototypes of interest. Most of these are things he's developed in his spare time, addressing areas he's felt were missing while working on numerous manufacturing-related projects.

### 📂 AI for Smart Factory
The integration of artificial intelligence in the smart factory sector is expected to become even more active in the future. Since high-tech manufacturing, such as semiconductors, often requires the use of Oracle Database, we developed a product based on this database. <br>

💡Big Data Analysis Enabler can be used in most Manufacturing fields and Major component systems. For more details on this, please see the side menu on the left.<br>

#### ✅ Big Data Analysis Enabler (BDAE)
This is a personal project, and was created for multi-purpose use, such as replacing PL/SQL, Function, etc. with Python, R for AI work, etc., in addition to Oracle Database's role as a storage.<br>
The purpose of this is to be able to immediately infer a model using data within the Oracle Database in the fastest way possible without moving data, as it is based on collected Oracle In-Database technology, and then to perform various data transformation tasks easily using Python, etc. and return them like general SQL results.

#### ✅ OPC-UA with Prosys SDK

Semiconductors have EAP, and equipment and EAP communicate based on the SECS/GEM protocol. However, this protocol applies only to semiconductor equipment, while auxiliary equipment such as pumps do not. While communication using different protocols can result in inconsistencies, this is crucial for yield. Therefore, the OPC-UA standard protocol was created to provide these equipment with the necessary tools.<br>

### 📂 New attempts
#### ✅ ROS2
As is widely known, ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open framework for robots and provides tools and libraries for developing, managing, and deploying robot software.
I recently became interested in this development because I thought it would be very effective to combine this with OPC-UA.

#### ✅ LLM + RAG + LoRA + ...
LLM may seem a bit far removed from the factory floor, as factories are closed spaces for security reasons. However, I don't think LLM itself is unnecessary. However, LLM requires unique models and RAGs tailored to specific factories. Furthermore, data is often tabular, making it somewhat different from traditional methods in this regard. We are currently experimenting with these approaches.

### 📂 Create an Android app
#### SlideMate : PowerPoint Presentation Helper,
I developed an Android app with AI. The AI's Vibe Coding assistant was ideal for rapid prototyping.

Tasks like multilingual support, icon creation, video creation, and UI modifications, which were incredibly tedious, would have been impossible to accomplish quickly without AI. I also personally believe that AI was incredibly effective at troubleshooting unfamiliar Android app development.
